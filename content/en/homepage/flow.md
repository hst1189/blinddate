###### STEP 1 Free Consultation
If you're not confident in romance, feel free to contact us for a consultation.

###### STEP 2 Admission & Membership Registration
Please prepare the necessary documents for the enrollment process and we will register you as a member.

We will recommend suitable candidates to you each month, so we will ask you in detail about yourself and your desired conditions for a partner. Your marriage partner isn't just anyone. We will provide personalized support, with a focus on your background and values.

###### STEP 3 Meeting Your Match
For traditional matchmaking services, there are standard locations for meeting, like hotel lobbies that are commonly used by all the agencies. We, however, do not use them often.

On Saturday and Sunday afternoons around 2-3 p.m., these places are filled with people on dates. When it's crowded, you have to stand and wait, which we don't think is a good situation. The initial meeting is important and should be a memorable one, so we arrange the meetings while considering both parties' residences and the atmosphere of the location.

###### STEP 4 Dating
If both parties feel a mutual attraction, you can start dating.

Matchmaking isn't a job interview or a search for a business partner. Your meetings will be during your private time on weekends and holidays. Instead of talking only about work, if you try to have an enjoyable conversation about your hobbies and things you're both interested in, most people will want to meet again and exchange contact information.

Once this happens, a counselor will support your relationship while maintaining a comfortable distance.

###### STEP 5 Engagement & Marriage
When both of you are ready, your data will be deleted and you will be withdrawn from our service.

We celebrate your new beginning as if we are sending off our graduates. When couples decide to get married, they often come to greet us, but since the initial interviews were one-on-one, it's the first time we meet you as a couple. We are always surprised at how different your expressions are from when you first enrolled.

Before enrolling, people are often full of anxiety, wondering if they'll really find someone. But once a match is made and the relationship goes smoothly, they consult with us less and less. Their expressions gradually soften, they smile more, and they become brighter. It's a moment when we can truly feel happy to have been a part of your journey, as the two of you look so well-matched and as if you had known each other even before joining our service.

If you'd like to hear more success stories of how two people with no prior connection can change their lives with a little courage and action, please come to our headquarters, and we'll tell you all about it in detail.
