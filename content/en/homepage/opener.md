###### ðŸŽŽ In Online Dating, "Messaging" Causes "Dating Fatigue." â€”Men Struggle to Keep Conversations Going; Women Are Overwhelmed by Incoming Messages. ðŸŽŽ
In the online dating market, there are more men than women, so women inevitably receive messages from many different men. For men, a generic message is likely to get lost, so they feel the need to write something unique. This "stress of thinking of a message to write" is a major cause of "dating fatigue." For women, having to exchange messages with multiple men every day leaves them with little time to enjoy each conversation, and they tend to get "tired of the act of messaging itself."

###### ðŸŽŽ "Dating Fatigue" Happens on Dates, Too! â€”30% of Women Said "Dates with People They Met Online Were Painful/Different from Their Expectations." ðŸŽŽ

Despite spending so much time getting ready, many women feel that the person they meet in real life is different from their expectations. This "disappointment with how dates go" seems to be another cause of dating fatigue.
