We would like to share some wonderful success stories from our members, based on their real experiences at Partner Agent.

###### Ms. K (30s, First Marriage, IT Professional, Tokyo)ï¼‰

They say timing is everything in marriage, but I became certain that "now" was the right time for me the night I was suddenly overcome with a sense of loneliness. In the midst of my busy daily life, I stopped and began to seriously think about my future. That's when the Mâ€™s Bridal Japan website caught my eye, and I booked a free online consultation. I met him, and from the impression I got during our first conversation, I just knew he was the one. Now we have a relationship where we can naturally talk about our future. I'm so proud of myself for taking that leap of faith.

###### Ms. F.N. (40s, First Marriage, Medical Professional, Kanagawa)

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first. I wondered, "Can you really meet a good person through a marriage agency?" But my counselor listened to my story carefully, and from that point on, I felt I could trust them. The man I was introduced to was very sincere from the beginning. Our conversation flowed so naturally, from talking about our jobs to our pets. It was a moment when I felt, "I've finally met someone I can truly connect with." I'm so surprised that I had such a future ahead of me (laughs).

###### Ms. S (40s, First Marriage, Tokyo)

Originally, I was reluctant about marriage, thinking, "I'd never go so far as to pay money for this or use a marriage agency." But as a doctor, I have very few opportunities to meet new people. When I turned 40, I started thinking seriously about my future, so I found this service and decided to give it a try. Since I'm quite busy, I just gave them my criteria and waited. They introduced me to someone who was a perfect match. When we met, he was so wonderful that I thought, "This is the one!" I nervously told him how I felt, and it turned out he felt the same way. Things moved along very smoothly from there, and we happily withdrew from the service upon our engagement. We'll walk the path of life together, and hopefully won't have to use your services again!
